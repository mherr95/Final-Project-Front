# Final-Project-Front
# Overview

For this last and final project here at General Assembly, I deceided to try and re-create my father's business website.

This is a dental office website. Once the user enters they will be welcomed with the websites Home page, containing important information. The user can then transition between pages with a stick nav bar at the top. Since this was a dental business and is more informational rather than functional I did not make it a full CRUD app. The stack that I used was one that was not as popular or well known. The PERN stack. For this backend I decieded to use Node.js/Express.js and connect it to a Postgres Database.

# Technologies Used

* Framework/Libraries - Postgres, Express.js, Node.js, and React.js

# Features
This full-stack web app was more an informative one and did not require a lot of functionality. 
On this web-app users are able to view information on the Dental clinic as well as request appointment/cancel appointment


# Future Improvements
* Add user login
* Add third-party API
